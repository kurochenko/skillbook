Overwrite? [y/N]\"\n   - If not exists: continue\n\n5. **Write skill**:\n   - Create skills/\u003cname\u003e/ directory if needed\n   - Copy file to skills/\u003cname\u003e/SKILL.md\n\n6. **Git commit**:\n   - `git add skills/\u003cname\u003e/SKILL.md`\n   - `git commit -m \"Add skill: \u003cname\u003e\"` (or \"Update skill: \u003cname\u003e\")\n\n7. **Output**:\n   - Success message with library path\n   - Show git commit hash for reference\n\n## Name Validation\n\n```typescript\n// Valid: beads, typescript, review-gitlab, my-skill-2\n// Invalid: Beads, _beads, my skill, a, 123-skill\n/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,49}$/\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Basic usage - name inferred from path\nskillbook add .claude/skills/beads/SKILL.md\n# ✓ Added skill 'beads' to library (commit: abc123)\n\n# With explicit name\nskillbook add ./my-file.md --name typescript\n# ✓ Added skill 'typescript' to library (commit: def456)\n\n# Force overwrite\nskillbook add .claude/skills/beads/SKILL.md --force\n# ✓ Updated skill 'beads' in library (commit: ghi789)\n\n# Identical content\nskillbook add .claude/skills/beads/SKILL.md\n# ℹ Skill 'beads' already up to date, skipped\n```\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- `src/commands/add.ts` - Main command implementation\n- `src/lib/library.ts` - Library operations (init, add skill)\n- `src/lib/git.ts` - Git operations (init, commit)\n- `src/lib/skills.ts` - Skill name extraction and validation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"kurochenko@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-23T18:00:58.331112+01:00","created_by":"Andrej Kurocenko","updated_at":"2026-01-23T19:27:46.880808+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-23T19:27:46.880808+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented add command with name extraction, validation, git integration, overwrite handling","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"skill-book-ndj","depends_on_id":"skill-book-0b8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T18:01:16.176139+01:00","created_by":"Andrej Kurocenko"},{"issue_id":"skill-book-ndj","depends_on_id":"skill-book-e35","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-23T18:01:16.239458+01:00","created_by":"Andrej Kurocenko"}]}
